"All that Blockfinder does is allow you to identify, contact and potentially
hack into every computer network in the world." - Rolling Stone, August 2010 [0]

Contrary to popular media claims, blockfinder is a simple text based console
tool that returns a list of netblocks for a given country.  It does this by
fetching the following lists of allocations:

    ftp://ftp.arin.net/pub/stats/arin/delegated-arin-latest
    ftp://ftp.ripe.net/ripe/stats/delegated-ripencc-latest
    ftp://ftp.afrinic.net/pub/stats/afrinic/delegated-afrinic-latest
    ftp://ftp.apnic.net/pub/stats/apnic/delegated-apnic-latest
    ftp://ftp.lacnic.net/pub/stats/lacnic/delegated-lacnic-latest

The list of ISO codes is ISO 3166-1 as found here:

    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1

blockfinder has two methods of operation:

    Update the lists of network object allocations
    Returning a list of all netblocks (or asn, etc) for a given country

To use blockfinder, first create or update the cache:

    blockfinder -i

Once you have a proper cache, search for the desired resource in the country
of your choice:

    ./blockfinder -v -t mm

Additionally, to filter results for a specific protocol you can use a selector:

    ./blockfinder -v -t mm:ipv4 


On Windows (in cmd, PowerShell and 4nt) one may find blockfinder.bat useful:

  blockfinder.bat
